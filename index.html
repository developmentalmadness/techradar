     <strong>Coarse-grained quadrants</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> elements of a software development process, such as experience design; and ways of structuring software, such micro-services.</li>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> components, such as databases, software development tools, such as versions control systems; or more generic categories of tools, such as the notion of polyglot persistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Platforms:</strong> things that we build software on top of: mobile technologies like Android, virtual platforms like the JVM, or generic kinds of platforms like hybrid clouds</li>
        <li><strong>Programming Languages and Frameworks</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <strong>Rings:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adopt:</strong> blips you should be using now; proven and mature for use</li>
        <li><strong>Trial:</strong> blips ready for use, but not as completely proven as those in the adopt ring; use on a trial basis, to decide whether they should be part of your toolkit</li>
        <li><strong>Assess:</strong> things that you should look at closely, but not necessarily trial yet - unless you think they would be a particularly good fit for you</li>
        <li><strong>Hold:</strong> things that are getting attention in the industry, but not ready for use; sometimes they are not mature enough yet, sometimes they are irredeemably flawed</li>

    </ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> there's no "avoid" ring, but throw things in the hold ring that people shouldn't use.
